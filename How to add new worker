1. Add new worker by adding this string to Vagrantfile

   config.vm.define "worker{x}" do |worker{x}|
       worker{x}.vm.box = "Gfast/Myworker"
       config.vm.box_version = "1.0.0"
       config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "{y}"
       config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 22, host: {z}
   end   

   there x is number of client, y unique ip adress and {z} unique port.

2. Type vagrant up worker{x} in console, new client with all necesarry files setups automaticly.

3. Edit Ansible hosts file(Ansible/hosts.txt)
   Copy this string
   worker{x} ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port={z} ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=../.vagrant/machines/worker{x}/virtualbox/private_key
   
   there x is number of client and z - assigned port.

4. Go to directory servers and copy file worker{x}.cfg to directory transfer.
   Raname  copyed file worker{x}.cfg in transfer directory and place your client number instead x.
   Open file and replace {y} with you unique ip in string 7. Find and replace all {x} with your client number.
   Run transfercfg script(./transfercfg)
   
   New client now working and monitored by nagios at main server.
